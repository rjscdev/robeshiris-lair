I would like to start by thanking everyone for the support you have given me, without you guys this would be nothing.
thank you very much for the 5k followers on pixiv and the 1k on baraag, seriously thank you very much.

as you may have noticed the site has changed, this is for the purpose of having a better management of it and to have certain things in order. 
the site was created with Hugo, a very good static site generator (Recommended).

in the left panel you can find all the options of the site, specially the commissions information (updated) so everything will be in order.
